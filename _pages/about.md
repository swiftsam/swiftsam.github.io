I live in Brooklyn with my family and work as the VP of Engineering at [Sealed](https://sealed.com/) where we accelerate residential energy efficiency and electrification by connecting contractors, homeowners, and government incentive programs. 

Before getting into the residential energy business, I led engineering and data teams at four other startups: 
- [Arcadia](https://www.arcadia.com/arc): led the data platform team in a growth-stage business executing on new product lines and substantial M&A moves. We modernized and fully integrate the data platform to support analytics in an increasing complicated company, but also to productionize derived data products for the new B2B data product, Arc. 
- [Bowery Farming](https://bowery.co/): joined right after series A as one of the first engineering hires and led range of data function (analytics, machine learning, data & ML engineering) for 4 years. Also had the opportunity to lead the software engineering and product management teams for a year each. I learned how to generalize my role as a leader beyond data, and to really appreciate good arugula. 
- [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/): as first data science hire early in the fintech wave, we figured out how to leverage an unprecedented view into financial decision making to build a more helpful product. I learned how to delivery something useful in a rapidly scaling tech company, and how to much taxes matter in investing. 
- [Good Judgment LLC](https://goodjudgment.com/): Led a team of graduate students, statisticians, and computer scientists productionalizing psychology and machine learning research for university spin-off competing to forecast geopolitical events for the national intelligence community. I learned that I liked building more than writing, and how CIA tries to make sense of a very complicated world.

I co-founded [Locally Optimistic](https://locallyoptimistic.com/) in 2018 with some friends from the NYC-based data leadership happy hour crowd. We wanted to create a space and offer views on doing work and leading teams in the data world. It has grown terrifically into a blog with tons of great contributors and a slack community with 5000+ members. 

Before my career in tech startups, I was an academic in the field of Behavioral Economics: the intersection of psychology and economics. I got my PhD at Carnegie Mellon from the Tepper School of Business studying [decision making, negotiation, and wisdom of the crowds forecasting](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8qB_WcUAAAAJ&hl=en).

I grew up in Richmond, VA which is a great place. I also owe Pittsburgh a long-term debt of gratitude for hosting me for 12 years.

I enjoy building things that seem worth building, [public speaking](/categories/#talks), boats, bikes, getting away from it all, and being right in the middle of it.
