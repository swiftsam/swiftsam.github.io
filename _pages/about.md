I live in Brooklyn and current work as the VP of Platform Data at [Arcadia](https://www.arcadia.com/arc) where we build the digital infrastructure to support the decarbonization and electrification of the energy system. You should [check it out](https://arcadia.com/referral?promo=sam98640) or [come work with me](https://www.arcadia.com/careers).

Before getting into the electrons business, I led data teams at three other startups: 
- Bowery Farming: 
- Betterment: as first data science hire early in the fintech wave, we figured out how to leverage an unprecedented view into financial decision making to build a more helpful product. 
- Good Judgment LLC: 

I co-founded [Locally Optimistic](https://locallyoptimistic.com/) in 2018 with some friends from the NYC-based data leadership happy hour crowd. We wanted to create a space and offer views on doing work and leading teams in the data world. It has grown terrifically into a blog with tons of great contributors and a slack community with 5000+ members. 

Before my career in tech startups, I was an academic in the field of Behavioral Economics: the intersection of pyschology and economics. I got my PhD at Carnegie Mellon from the Tepper School of Business studying [decision making, negotiation, and wisdom of the crowds forecasting](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8qB_WcUAAAAJ&hl=en).

I enjoy building things that seem worth building, [public speaking](/categories/#talks), boats, bikes, getting away from it all, and being right in the middle of it.

I grew up in Richmond, VA which is a great place. I also owe Pittsburgh a long-term debt of gratitude for hosting me for 12 years.
